Pre-requirements:
1. Make sure you have python 3.6 installed. To check your version, type python --v in the command line.

Library instillation instructions:
Most likely you will not have pyaudio and numpy installed. If this is the case
simply install them by doing pip install pyaudio, and pip install numpy. Depending on your
python setup you may be able to type this anywhere from the commandline or you may have to
navigate to where the pip script is located.

In the code, the default IP is currently set to 127.0.0.1 (localhost). Change this to the
IP of the other device or specify the other person's IP with the commandline arguments. See
the comments in the code for more details on how to do this.

Also note that both devices need to be on the same network, connected with ethernet or wifi.

You are now ready to run the code.
