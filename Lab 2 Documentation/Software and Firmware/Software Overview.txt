These are the software files for the voice over IP device.

The software consists of one file [insert filename here] that starts as server and a client.
The client connects to the other person's IP and the server waits for a connection by the 
other person's client. Once both clients are connected to the other person's server the 
conversation can start. When a person talks, their analog voice is recored, converted to digital
bytes and serialized, encoded, sent to the other person, decoded, reodered and converted
back to analog format, and then played to the other person. For more details on how this works
and what libraries are used see the documentation in the code([insert filename here]). The setup
instruction has more details on how to download these libraries.
